# LLM RAG Chatpot with LangChain and Neo4j
## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on building an LLM-powered chatbot that leverages hospital system data and associated business requirements to demonstrate understanding that is useful in answering some key health questions. The chatbot is powered by a `LangChain` inspired retrieval-augmented generation approach that utilizes a graph database management suite, `Neo4j` in tandem with `ChromaDB` an LLM-friendly vector database.
